        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Dawson Posekany, a prospective Electrical Engineer. I'm currently pursuing my degree at Iowa State University, where I'm honing my skills in circuit design, signal processing, and embedded systems.
            In this directory, you'll find my resume and overviews of some of the projects I have worked on throughout my academic career.
        </p>
          <p>
             I apply classroom teachings through my contributions to the Advanced Manufacturing Club and the Amateur Radio Club here on campus. I seek to leverage my technical skills and passion for innovation to contribute to a company that values creativity and forward-thinking solutions.
             I am always looking to develop my skillset through learning new circuit design and simulation tools, messing with arduino projects, and learning programming languages such as Python, C, and java. 
        </p>
        <p>
             
          I am excited for my Electrical Engineering co-op with Collins Aerospace beginning this summer at their Manchester, IA location. I hope to gain valuable industry experience and work with seasoned professionals to further develop my skills and contribute to impactful projects.
        </p>
