        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Dawson Posekany, a prospective Electrical Engineer. I'm currently pursuing my degree at Iowa State University, where I'm honing my skills in circuit design, signal processing, and embedded systems.
            I apply classroom teachings through my contributions to the Advanced Manufacturing Club and the Amateur Radio Club here on campus. I seek to leverage my technical skills and passion for innovation to contribute to a company that values creativity and forward-thinking solutions.
            
            In this directory, you'll find my resume and overviews of some of the project I have worked on throughout my academic career.
        </p>
